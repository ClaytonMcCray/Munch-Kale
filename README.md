# Munch-Kale
The munch interpreter for the Kale programming language, created by me.

Kale is a simple programming language that I have created.
I believe it is turing complete. munch.py is the interpreter;
programs can be run from the command line with
`./munch.py FILENAME.kale` 
if you make the interpreter executable. Otherwise, Python 3.X
should work (i.e. `python3 munch.py FILENAME.kale`); specifically,
the interpreter was written and tested with python 3.5.
Another option is to add it to your .bashrc alias.
